# Torsie

In collaboration with textile artist Ren√©e Strikkeling I looked for a way to display the versatility of the torsion of strings and 
the impact it has on a fabric as a whole. Using Javascript and the p5.js library I created a website that displays a variety of
fabric patterns and structures. The user can dynamically change the colors of the patterns, letting them see the impact it has
on it and showing the infinite possibilities.
